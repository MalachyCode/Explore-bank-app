        The founders, led by Mr. Nwafor Malachy, aimed to revolutionize the
        banking sector in Nigeria. They believed in the potential of the
        Nigerian economy and wanted to contribute to its growth by providing
        innovative banking solutions. In its first year, Explore Bank obtained
        its banking license from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
